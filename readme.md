# Gaussian process node
This node has the implementation of the Sparse Gaussian process regression. The training points are selected by placing a 3x3 grid on the laser hitpoint and selecting the 9 corresponding points. The pseudo points are selected as the unique points from this training dataset. The value at the pseudo point is the mean of the TSDF value of all the training points that condense into that pseudo point.

## File structure
* The major implementations are in the src/gaussian_map/lib directory.
* The robot2D and the map2D classes are written as a base for further development and testing the gpModel.

## Build
1. Build instructions

Navigate to catkin_workspace directory
~~~~
cd <ros_ws> 
catkin_make
~~~~
To run the mapping example, you need to setup the rviz by creating these maps.
2. for visualizing the map generated by the ros node
~~~~ 
cd <ros_ws>
rosrun rviz rviz -d scan.rviz
~~~~


3. For running the ros node 
* Ensure that the data file is in ros_ws directory
* we are using Intel lab dataser for this package 
~~~~
cd <ros_ws>
source devel/setup/bash
rosrun gaussian_map gp_map
~~~~
